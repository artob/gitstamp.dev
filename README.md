Gitstamp is a specification and service for timestamping Git commits using
the [Arweave] permaweb.

By timestamping Git commits permanently and uncensorably on Arweave, it is
easy to prove to any third party that a particular commit was created no
later than at the time when it was timestamped.

## Sample

The Git commit metadata is recorded on the blockweave as follows:

## Specification

To be written.

## Usage

The easiest way to timestamp your Git commits is to use our [GitHub Actions
integration](https://github.com/artob/gitstamp-action).

Future integrations with GitLab and Bitbucket are planned.
